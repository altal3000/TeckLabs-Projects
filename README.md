# TeckLabs-Projects

These two notebooks are the result of collective work by two teams of students from the TechLabs Hamburg Digital Shaper Program. Each team consisted of 5â€“6 members who collaborated and distributed the tasks across the projects. While I cannot claim these projects as solely my own, I actively contributed to their development.
